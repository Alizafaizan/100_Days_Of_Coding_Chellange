// Question 21: Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

let friendName: string[] = ['Faizan', 'Faiz', 'Rafy'];
console.log(friendName[3]);//International error: beacuse Array are 0 index, so index 3 is out of bound.
console.log(friendName[2]);//Correcting the error by accessing a valid index.
